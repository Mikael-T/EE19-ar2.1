        <p>Sir Robert Bryson Hall II[a] (born January 22, 1990), known professionally as Logic, is a retired American
            rapper, songwriter, and record producer, as well as a streamer and author. As a rapper, Logic released six
            studio albums and received two Grammy nominations.</p>

        <p>Logic began his music career in 2010, releasing the mixtape Young, Broke & Infamous; he gained popularity
            with his Young Sinatra mixtape series, with the response to its third iteration, Young Sinatra: Welcome to
            Forever (2013), helping Logic secure a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings. Logic's first two studio
            albums — Under Pressure (2014) and The Incredible True Story (2015) — both peaked within the top five on the
            U.S. Billboard 200 and were certified gold.</p>
