        <p>Miguel Jontel Pimentel (born October 23, 1985) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and actor.
            Raised in San Pedro, California, he began pursuing a music career at age thirteen. After signing to Jive
            Records in 2007, Miguel released his debut studio album, All I Want Is You, in November 2010. Although it
            was underpromoted upon its release, the album became a sleeper hit and helped Miguel garner commercial
            standing.</p>
        <p>After Jive's dissolution in 2011, he moved to RCA Records and released his second studio album, Kaleidoscope
            Dream, in 2012 to critical acclaim. In June 2015, Miguel released his third album, Wildheart, which also
            received critical acclaim. His fourth studio album War & Leisure was released in 2017 to further acclaim.
            Miguel incorporates R&B, funk, hip hop, rock and electronic styles into his music, and has been compared to
            vocalists Babyface and Prince.</p>
