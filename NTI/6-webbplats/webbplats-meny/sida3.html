        <p>Charles Otto Puth Jr. (/puːθ/; born December 2, 1991) is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. His initial exposure came through the viral success of his song videos uploaded to YouTube.</p>

        <p>After initially signing with eleveneleven after performing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Puth began contributing to songs and albums for other artists such as Cody Simpson, Livingston Taylor, and Skizzy Mars; as well as creating lite solo material and covers of popular songs. With primary intent on a solo career, Atlantic Records eventually sought the artist and released his debut single, "Marvin Gaye" featuring Meghan Trainor in 2015.[3] Coinciding with the single came his first feature, "See You Again", which he co-wrote, co-produced, and performed with Wiz Khalifa for the Furious 7 soundtrack as a tribute to Paul Walker. It peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 for 12 non-consecutive weeks. After the success of "See You Again", he gained worldwide recognition for multiple subsequent releases, including his next single "One Call Away". The single reached number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100, and topped charts in New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, and the United Kingdom.</p>
